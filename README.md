# Exchange web application "Stonks"

## Project specification

The prototype of a web application for making transactions in the foreign exchange market. On the main page there is a list of news to help you make the right investment decision. For each news, the user can read the title and a brief description of the article, as well as follow the link to the source. Also on the main page there are exchange rates. The user can register and log into the account. After that, sections such as a wallet, with the ability to track the history of changes will become available. Processes such as wallet replenishment, currency conversion, buying and selling currency will also become available. If necessary, the user can log out of the account. There are also roles for users. To date there are User role and Admin role. Admin's account has much more functionality. Admin can see the list of all application users and see their balance. Abilities to create, block and unblock users, change their balance and roles will be available later.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
